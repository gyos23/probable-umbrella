## Step 5: Submit Build (5 minutes)

## Step 6: Release in App Store Connect (5 minutes)

1. Go back to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com

4. Your build should appear under "Build"
5. Select it
6. Click **"Save"**
7. Click **"Submit for Review"**

---

## Step 7: Wait ⏰

Apple reviews your app (usually 1-2 days, max 7 days).

You'll get emails about the status:
- ✉️ "In Review" → Apple is testing
- ✉️ "Approved" → You're live! 🎉
- ✉️ "Rejected" → Fix issue and resubmit (common, don't worry!)

---

## Step 8: Go Live! 🎉

When approved:
- Option 1: Auto-release (set this in App Store Connect)
- Option 2: Manual release (you click "Release")

**Done! Your app is in the App Store!** 🍾

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't have a Mac"
No problem! EAS Build handles everything:
```bash
eas build --platform ios --auto-submit
```

### "Build failed"
Clear cache and try again:
```bash
eas build --clear-cache --platform ios
```

### "Can't afford $99 Apple Developer fee yet"
You can still build and test for free! Just can't publish to App Store.

Test locally:
```bash
npm run ios  # Opens in simulator
```

### "Apple rejected my app"
Don't panic! ~40% of first submissions get rejected.
- Read their email carefully
- Fix the issue
- Resubmit (free, no penalty)

Common reasons:
- Missing privacy policy
- Crash on launch (test more!)
- Not following App Store guidelines

---

## 🔄 Updates Later

To release an update:

1. Make your code changes
2. Update version in `app.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0.1"  // Increment this
   }
   ```
3. Build and submit:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios
   eas submit --platform ios
   ```

1. Use it for a few weeks
2. Fix any bugs users report
3. Submit to Design Awards (April-May window)
4. Announcement at WWDC in June

## 💡 One More Thing...

**Test on TestFlight first!**

After `eas build`, your app is automatically available on TestFlight.

**Share with friends:**
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
# Gets you a TestFlight link to share
```

They can install and test before you submit to App Store!

**That's it! 30 minutes and you're on the App Store! 🚀**

(Well, 30 minutes of your time + 1-7 days of Apple review time 😅)
